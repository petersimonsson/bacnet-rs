//! Error types for the high-level BACnet client.
//!
//! The client returns a single, typed [`ClientError`] from all of its public
//! methods. This replaces the previous `Box<dyn std::error::Error>` returns and
//! lets callers match on specific failure modes (timeouts, protocol-level
//! rejects/aborts, per-property errors, etc.) instead of inspecting strings.
