## [0.3.2] - 2026-09-01

This release adds **COV notification** support and **router discovery**, consolidates the BVLL header implementation,
fixes the Who-Is broadcast framing, and restores the **no-std build**.

### Added

- **COV notifications** (#70, thanks @petersimonsson): full encoding *and*
  decoding for COV notification and subscription services:
  - `CovNotificationRequest::decode` and a new `CovNotificationProperty` type modelling `BACnetPropertyValue`, including
    the optional
    `propertyArrayIndex` and `priority` fields
  - `encode_context_boolean` / `decode_context_boolean` in `encoding`
  - `ConfirmedServiceChoice::ConfirmedCOVNotification` (service choice 1)
- **Router discovery and routed client requests** (#66): the client now sends Who-Is-Router-To-Network, collects
  `DiscoveredRouter` answers, learns each device's route from routed I-Am responses (`DeviceInfo::route`), and addresses
  confirmed requests through the right router via `BacnetTarget`
- `Ord`/`PartialOrd` for `ObjectIdentifier` and all `generate_custom_enum!`
  types, so they can be used as `BTreeMap`/`BTreeSet` keys (#72, thanks @petersimonsson)
- `rust-version = "1.88"` declared in `Cargo.toml`, making the MSRV official and visible to cargo; the CI MSRV check
  moved from 1.75 to 1.88 accordingly

### Changed

- `Apdu::Abort` now carries a typed `AbortReason` instead of a raw `u8` (#67, thanks @petersimonsson)
- **Breaking:** `SubscribeCovRequest::with_lifetime` takes an
  `issue_confirmed_notifications` parameter, and
  `CovNotificationRequest.list_of_values: Vec<PropertyValue>` was replaced by
  `properties: Vec<CovNotificationProperty>` (#70)

### Fixed

- `who_is`/`who_is_to` now send Who-Is as a global-broadcast NPDU (DNET
  `0xFFFF`, hop count 255) inside an Original-Broadcast-NPDU BVLC when the target is a broadcast address, matching YABE
  and the reference bacnet-stack; unicast targets get a plain local NPDU inside Original-Unicast-NPDU instead of the
  previous broadcast-BVLC/local-NPDU mix (#58)
- `BvlcFunction` in `datalink::bip` now matches ASHRAE 135 Annex J:
  `SecureBvll` moved from `0x0D` to its standard code `0x0C`, the nonstandard
  `ForwardedNpduFromDevice` variant was removed, and the missing `Result`
  (`0x00`) and `WriteBroadcastDistributionTable` (`0x01`) functions were added
- `SubscribeCovRequest::encode` used hand-rolled tag bytes that truncated the process identifier and lifetime to one
  byte (a 3600 s lifetime went out as 16 s) and mis-declared the boolean's tag length; it now uses the proper context
  encodings (#70)
- The no-std build (`cargo build --no-default-features`) compiles again — it had ~200 accumulated errors: missing
  `alloc` imports (`Vec`, `String`,
  `Box`, `vec!`, `format!`, `ToString`) across 18 modules, `std::` paths in code shared with no-std (now `core::`), the
  `generate_custom_enum!` macro emitting `std::fmt` impls, the std-only `util::statistics` module (uses
  `Instant`/`Arc`/`Mutex`) not being feature-gated, and `f64::powi`/`f64::log2`
  (std-only) used in retry backoff and frame-entropy calculations
- New `clippy::chunks_exact_to_as_chunks` lint (Rust 1.98) failing CI: UTF-16 and network-list decoding now use
  `as_chunks::<2>()` (needs Rust 1.88, hence the MSRV bump)

### Removed

- Removed the duplicate `BvllHeader`/`BvllFunction`/`BvllType` types from the
  `transport` module; the transport layer now reuses (and re-exports)
  `datalink::bip::{BvlcHeader, BvlcFunction}` so there is a single BVLL header implementation
- Removed a redundant local `read_objects_properties` helper from the
  `device_objects` example in favour of the client method of the same name (#61, thanks @amab8901)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-06-30

This release introduces a synchronous **client API** (`BacnetClient`),
device discovery plus typed read/write, and resolves a
security-audit advisory in the dependency tree.

### Added

- **Client API** (`src/client/`):
  - `BacnetClient` with a builder-based `ClientConfig` (host, port, timeout, retries)
    and a typed `ClientError` returned from every operation
  - `who_is()` / `who_is_to(target, low, high)` device discovery returning `Vec<DeviceInfo>`
  - `read_property()` returning all decoded `PropertyValue`s for the request
  - `write_property()` with optional priority (1–16) for commandable objects
  - `write_property_verified()` returning `WriteOutcome` (`Verified` /
    `NotEffective { read_back }`) confirms a write actually took effect by reading
    the value back, with a short retry loop to absorb device settling time
  - `InvokeIdAllocator` for transaction invoke-ID correlation
  - `timeout()` and `local_addr()` accessors
- `Client::new_with_local_addr` for binding a specific IPv4/IPv6 address and
  ephemeral port (replaces `new_with_local_port`)
- `AbortReason` enumeration (ASHRAE 135 `BACnetAbortReason`) surfaced through
  `ClientError::Abort`, with `Custom`/`Reserved` handling for vendor/reserved codes
- Human-readable decoding of BACnet error class/code pairs in client error messages
- New `read_write_property` example (discover → read → write/verify → relinquish)
  using the client API
- Client integration and device-discovery tests (`tests/client_confirmed.rs`,
  `tests/client_discovery.rs`)

### Changed

- `EngineeringUnits` ordering and documentation aligned with ANSI/ASHRAE
  Standard 135-2024; `micro-siemens` renamed to `microsiemens`
- `AbortReason` is now generated via `generate_custom_enum!` (auto `From`/`Display`
  and `Custom`/`Reserved` variants) instead of a hand-written impl; its `Display`
  output is now PascalCase, consistent with `RejectReason`
- `generate_custom_enum!` no longer emits a module-level `use serde::{...}`; it
  uses fully-qualified paths in its derives so the macro can be invoked more than
  once per module
- `BACNET_IP_PORT` moved into the `datalink::bip` module
- Examples migrated to the high-level client API where applicable; `whois_scan`
  reworked to use `BacnetClient`
- Object-identifier scanning now uses `decode_object_identifier` instead of manual
  byte slicing

### Fixed

- Socket receive loops now treat both `WouldBlock` and `TimedOut` as timeouts,
  fixing a cross-platform timeout bug on Windows (`WSAETIMEDOUT`)
- Clippy warnings resolved; conditional logic refactored to `if let` guards

### Removed

- Removed the unused optional `env_logger` dependency, which transitively pulled in
  the unmaintained `proc-macro-error2` crate (RUSTSEC-2026-0173) via `jiff` → `defmt`
- Removed the `advanced_device`, `comprehensive_whois_scan`, `debug_formatter`, and
  `debug_properties` examples and the per-folder example READMEs to streamline the
  example set

- `BACnetTag` enum and `decode_tag()` for generic application/context tag decoding
- `encode_unsigned64`, `decode_unsigned64`, `encode_signed64`, `decode_signed64` for 64-bit integers
- `PropertyValue::Double(f64)` and `PropertyValue::OctetString(Vec<u8>)` variants
- `Display` impl for `PropertyValue` (behind `std` feature)
- `encode()`/`decode()` methods on `ReadPropertyMultipleRequest`, `ReadAccessSpecification`, `PropertyReference`,
  `ReadPropertyResponse`
- Serde support (behind `serde` feature) for `NetworkAddress`, `ObjectIdentifier`, `Segmentation`, `Polarity`,
  `PropertyValue`, and all `generate_custom_enum!` types
- `ProtocolServicesSupported` using `bitflags!` macro
- `TryFrom<u8>` for `BvlcFunction` and `NetworkMessageType`
- `TryFrom<u32>` for `Segmentation` and `Polarity`
- `Display` impl for `Segmentation`
- Helper functions `set_source()` and `set_destination()` on `Npdu`
- `NetworkAddress` now implements `Hash`

### Fixed

- `UnconfirmedServiceChoice` conversion from `u8` was incorrect
- `service_choice` was being double-converted in APDU handling
- `Apdu::Error` variant handling was broken
- Removed broken `bincode` dependency
- Pinned `crc` to `3.3.*` for MSRV compatibility

### Changed

- README updated with honest implementation status table and WIP notice
- CI: replaced `cargo install cargo-deny --locked` with `taiki-e/install-action@cargo-deny` (pre-built binary)
- ~450 lines of duplicate/broken unit mapping code removed from `property.rs`
- Duplicate property value decoding functions consolidated into `decode_property_value()`
- `decode_property_value()` now returns `Result` instead of `Option`
