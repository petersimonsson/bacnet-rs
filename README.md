# BACnet-RS

A BACnet (Building Automation and Control Networks) protocol stack implementation in Rust.

> **Note:** This library is under active development and not yet production-ready. APIs may change between releases.
> Contributions and feedback are welcome.

## Overview

This library provides an implementation of the BACnet protocol stack in Rust, targeting compliance with ANSI/ASHRAE
Standard 135-2024. It supports multiple data link layers, core BACnet services, and is designed for both embedded and
desktop applications.

## Quick Start

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
bacnet-rs = "0.3"
```

### Feature Flags

- `std` (default): Standard library support with networking capabilities
- `async` (default): Async/await support with Tokio runtime
- `serde` (default): Serialization support for BACnet types

To use without async support:
```toml
bacnet-rs = { version = "0.3", default-features = false, features = ["std"] }
```

## Architecture

The stack is organized into layered modules:

- **Encoding** (`src/encoding/`): BACnet data encoding/decoding, ASN.1 tag handling
- **Datalink** (`src/datalink/`): BACnet/IP, MS/TP, Ethernet implementations
- **Network** (`src/network/`): NPDU handling and routing
- **Service** (`src/service/`): BACnet service request/response implementations
- **Object** (`src/object/`): Standard BACnet object types and database
- **Application** (`src/app/`): APDU handling and segmentation
- **Client** (`src/client/`): High-level BACnet client API

## Examples

The high-level [`BacnetClient`](src/client/mod.rs) is the recommended entry point
for talking to devices. The client-focused examples:

```bash
# Discover every device on the local network (broadcast Who-Is)
cargo run --example whois_scan

# Discover one device, then read its object list and properties
cargo run --example test_client 10.161.1.211

# Read a single property
cargo run --example read_write_property 10.161.1.211 analogValue 4

# Write Present_Value and verify it took effect (priority 8)
cargo run --example read_write_property 10.161.1.211 analogValue 4 5.0 8

# Relinquish a commanded priority slot (write Null)
cargo run --example read_write_property 10.161.1.211 analogValue 4 relinquish 8
```

Lower-level examples (`routed_device_discovery` for network routing, and the
device-side `responder_device`) drive the data-link or server layers directly for
cases the client does not cover.
